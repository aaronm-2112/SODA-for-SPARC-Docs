## Background

Sometimes users may encounter network issues when trying to reach Pennsieve or even the SODA server.
This is more common for the following users:

- Users that have installed SODA on a device managed by an IT/IS/networking team
- Users that are connected to their work network while using SODA
-

For the above users, and potentially others, network issues have numerous causes and the best way to resolve these issues is likely by working with your network administrator/IT team.

## Steps

Here is what the SODA team suggests for resolving the situation with your IT/IS/networking team:

1. Navigate to the 'Contact Us' page in the sidebar.
2. Click the 'Gather Logs' button and select a directory where you would like SODA to generate its error logs.
3. Contact your network administrator and provide them with the logs.
4. If the network administrator is unable to resolve the issue, please contact the SODA team for further assistance by sending the logs to help@fairdataihub.org`;
